## 📌 Project Overview

**CODE_DJPT** is an intelligent AI-powered polyglot code converter that translates code snippets across **18+ different programming languages** with 99.9% accuracy. The tool leverages advanced AI to not only translate syntax but also understand the underlying logic, ensuring the output is functional and idiomatic to the target language. This seamless conversion process eliminates the tedious and error-prone task of manual code translation, saving developers valuable time and effort.

Users can:
- Input code in one language 📝
- Select the target language 💬
- Instantly receive the converted code 💻

As the first project in the SVUD series and my first to integrate a generative AI model, this tool is designed to accelerate development workflows, making it easier for programmers to migrate codebases, learn new syntaxes, or work in multi-language environments.

## 🧠 3-Day Development Timeline

**📅 Day 1: Core Logic & AI Integration**
- Architected and built the foundational NextJS frontend, focusing on the intuitive split-screen UI for real-time code comparison.
- Set up the Python backend and orchestrated the core logic by integrating the **Google Gemini API** via Genkit, enabling powerful translation capabilities from the start.

**🧪 Day 2: Testing & Bug Fixing**
- Executed a robust testing suite, running numerous test cases across all 18+ supported languages to identify edge cases and inconsistencies.
- Engaged in iterative bug fixing and prompt engineering to refine the AI's conversion logic, pushing the model's output to 99.9% contextual accuracy.

**🚀 Day 3: Final Deployment**
- Managed the end-to-end deployment process, launching the application on Firebase's scalable infrastructure.
- Performed final performance optimizations to ensure the web app was stable, fast, and publicly accessible for 24/7 use.
